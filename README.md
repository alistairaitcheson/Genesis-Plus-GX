A modified version of GenesisPlusGX - if you like it, go to https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX and donate something there. 

I just did the all the hacky extra features, not building the emulator in the first place, and ekeeke put in a lot of work to make something so great for nuisances like me to work off of.

I'm doing this as a hobby project, and I was new to C when I started this, so it is very messy right now and needs a bit of a refactor and a lot of commenting!
